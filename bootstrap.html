    Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
    It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
    Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). 
    The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.
     As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements.
