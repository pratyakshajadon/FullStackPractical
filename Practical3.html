    <h2>About this course:</h2>
    <p>Front-end web Development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.
     Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
