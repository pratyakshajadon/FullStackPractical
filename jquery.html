    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, 
    event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
    With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
    JQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. 
    This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets.
